This is my first post, how exciting!

I've been looking for a solid WordPress alternative for a long time, and it 
looks like that wait is finally over.

I never imagined that the solution would be to go back to basics with static 
HTML based blog. Static HTML content generation is a solid alternative to 
database driven blogs, and it's blazing fast. Hats off to the Jekyll team 
for dreaming up this idea. I am convinced that it will do nicely for me.

Setting up the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) 
theme for Jekyll has been a breeze, and the blog was up and running in 
minutes. It also happens that Jekyll powered blogs can be hosted on GitHub 
Pages for free, which was another pleasant surprise.
