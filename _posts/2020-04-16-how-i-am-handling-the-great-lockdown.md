The Covid-19 pandemic has put the enitre world in a state of lockdown. We are 
no longer able to do a lot of things that we used to take for granted. Simple 
pleasures such as, catching a movie, having dinner with loved ones in your 
favorite restaurant, riding the metro, and even going for a stroll around the 
block is no longer possible.

If the latest [IMF projections](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020) 
are any indication, a real recovery would take years. If the economic experts 
are to be believed, we come to the harsh conclusion that we are in it for the 
long haul. Once we get over the initial shock, there is more doom, and gloom 
on the way with companies set to reduce workforce, and freeze hiring. 
Unemployed folks are going to find it extra difficult to find a new job, and 
the ones that are already working will have hold on to their dear jobs. In 
hard times such as this, it is all the more important to look at the bright 
side and plan ahead. Our new found extra time could be put to good use. 
Keeping these in mind, I have taken up additional projects for betterment 
during this period, which I shall list below.

# Learning how to learn

This course has been in my to-do list for a long time. It's a bit ironic 
considering the fact that understanding and beating procrastination is one 
of the central tenets of this course. There is no better time to learn the 
skills that are taught in this course. I have learned a lot about how the brain 
works, best practices to learn, and retain what you have learned. The course 
is aimed not just for students, but anyone who wishes to learn, and enrich 
their lives from what they have learned. I am only two weeks into this four 
week course, but I already feel that everyone should be aware of the 
techniques taught in this course to improve their study habits, and study 
outcome. So, I do recommend it, and I shall write a detailed blog post once I 
complete the course. You can study [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) for free ($49 if you 
want a verified certificate) at Coursera.


# Become a better cook

I am not new to cooking. My first attempt at cooking was a decade ago in 2009, 
when I moved to Sweden for my master's degree. The high cost of living meant 
that I had to quickly graduate from making instant noodles, and sandwiches to 
 a decent cook in relatively short time. I enjoyed this period of my life, and 
 made good progress with my culinary skills. Things changed after my marriage 
 to Ranju (who is awesome cook), who took over the kitchen duties from me. I 
 happy being the assistant chef, helping out occasionally but I rarely cooked 
 on my own.

Things are different now though. I am cooking again, starting with simple stir 
fries and noodle soups. I slowly progressed to making simple curries, and 
Indian dishes. I started to make use of the oven that came with the cooking 
range. Cooking with a different heat source is challenging, and the resulting 
food sure is delicious. I also happen to be reading "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" by 
Samin Nosrat. So, I view this period as a good opportunity to practice many 
things I've learned from this book. Oh, by the way, this book is a great place 
to start if you want to improve your cooking, and do not know where to start.

# Sugar free April

Ranju and I decided to skip added sugar for the whole month of April. We avoid 
foods with high, or added sugar, except for the 2-3 cheat meals we have during 
week. This means no more milkshakes, ice cream, and even the 1 teaspoon sugar 
that we add to the tea we take. In addition to this, we avoid high glycemic 
fruits such as grapes. It is okay to consume fruits on the lower end (<55 on 
the index) of the [Glycemic Index](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods). 
So, apple, oranges, and plum, etc. are good. We are also avoiding starchy 
foods like potatoes, and rice on most days, having substituted it with 
wheat-based chapattis, and rotis.

I have noticed that my energy levels are much more consistent now, probably 
due to far fewer spikes in insulin levels. This has helped me put in couple of 
good hours during the usual afternoon slump between 13:00 and 16:00 hours. 
I've already lost 0.7 kgs just two weeks into this experiment. It has been so 
successful, I have decided to continue this after April.

# Phone-a-friend.

Before the lockdown, we were all too busy to stay in touch with near and dear 
ones. This is especially true for me, as I rarely make calls except on special 
occasions. These days, I am making a concentrated effort to call up old 
friends now that I have plenty of time. To kick things started, I had a long 
(2+ hours) of Zoom meeting with a group of my oldest friends, who are now 
living in different parts of the world, spread across 5 continents. This was 
such a great experience, as all of us had never gathered at the same time 
since 2005.

I am now calling a friend or a family member every two days to catch up. I 
feel that this helps me deal with the social isolation that comes with the 
great lockdown. We may be at faraway places, but it need not feel that way. 
Thanks to technology, we are now better connected than ever. So, let's make 
good use of it.


# Wholesome entertainment

You can only achieve so much productivity in a day. It's important to let your 
hair down and relax as well. Since I won't be getting my movie fix in the 
theaters in the foreseeable future, I am putting my HD TV to good use. Instead 
of mindlessly consuming YouTube videos, I decided to watch some good movies 
instead.

I had watched the Oscar winning Korean movie Parasite in February, and it 
opened my eyes, and ears to world cinema. I had seen some Swedish, and German 
movies during my stay in Sweden, but I realized that I had not seen any new 
foreign films in the years that followed. A quick google search revealed 
[Empire magazine's 100 greatest films from world cinema](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/100-greatest-world-cinema-films/), which goes like this:

> From Brazil to Japan to France and Senegal, from Neo-Realism to Dogme to 
J-horror, we've compiled a list of the very best films not in the English 
language (note: features, not documentaries). So rustle up some sushi, 
strike up a gauloise and make sure you've locked your bicycle as we count 
down the top 100 world cinema movies...


As humans we come from different places, belong to many cultures, and speak 
many languages, but human emotions, pain, and suffering are universal. After 
watching half a dozen movies from this list, it was enlightening to realize 
that. It was time well spent.
