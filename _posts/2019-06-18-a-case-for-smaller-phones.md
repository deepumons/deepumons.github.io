title: A case for smaller phones
tags: [opinion]

I got a brand new Pocophone last week to replace my aging Xiaomi Mi5. At INR 
18,000 (about $260) this phone offers flag ship level specifictions at nearly 
1/3rd the cost. Needless to say, I am mighty impressed with its price and 
performance, so I do recommend it.

My only complaint is how bigger and heavier this phone is compared to the 
Mi 5. At 182 grams, the pocophone is 50 grams heavier than the Mi5. It is 
also slightly taller, wider and thicker than the Mi5. All of this makes it 
difficult for one handed with my dainty hands.

I am thankful for the larger screen and the 4,000 mAh battery, but I just 
hope that the race towards bigger and better phones won't leave us with 
carpal tunnel syndrome. Here's hoping that the companies would also consider 
making phones with smaller screens in the future.
