---

My name is Deepak Rajendran, a <a href="https://liu.se/en">LiU</a> (Link√∂ping 
University, Sweden) alumnus with a masters degree in Computer Science and 
Engineering. I have 10 years of work experience spanning web development, 
academic research, software support and IT incident management.

I have been studying Machine Learning and applied Data Science from 
early 2019, and I've learned a ton about Exploratory Data Analysis, Data 
Wrangling, building, testing and evaluating Machine Learning models, and Data 
Visualization during this time.

I am currently looking for opportunities as a Data Analyst, Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
I am always interested in new projects and opportunities. So feel free to get in touch with me.
