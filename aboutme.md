---

My name is Deepak Rajendran, a <a href="https://liu.se/en">LiU</a> 
(Link√∂ping University, Sweden) alumnus with a masters degree in Computer 
Science and Engineering. I have 10 years of work experience spanning web 
development, academic research, software support and IT incident management.

I have been studying Machine Learning and applied Data Science from early 
2019, and I've learned a ton about Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, 
building, testing and evaluating Machine Learning models, and Data 
Visualization during this time.

I currently live in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. I am looking for 
opportunities as a Data Analyst, Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
I am always interested in new projects and opportunities. So feel free to get 
in touch with me.
